How does a Resume look on the grid

Skills

Machine Learning

I'm familiar with most modern ML Frameworks such as Tensorflow and Caffe. I am always eagerly looking for creative applications of ML and Data Science.

Featured Project: [WaterSavr][0] - HackNYU Sustainabilty and Social Impact Prize Winner

The goal of this project was the measure the amount of water being used from microphone input. I created a dataset of a few dozen audio files for each of 3 common water appliances (faucets, showers and toilets) and trained a model to classify audio sounds as being one of the three appliances or neither. As it was a hackathon project, the accuracy rates left a little bit to be desired but audio processing the model was be able predict with about 65% accuracy the source of the water. The next step was using the duration of the water flow and the appliance being used to calculate the amount of water being used. For this naive implementation I simply looked up the flow rates for each appliance I tested with at NYU but a more sophisticated model may be able to predict usage without this feature.

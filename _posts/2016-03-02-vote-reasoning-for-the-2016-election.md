Election 2016 Voting Record

March 1, 2016 - Virginia Primary

Primary: Republican Primary

Reasoning: So I plan on voting for the Democratic candidate in the general election but I voted in the Republican primary today. My reasoning is that I'm more or less indifferent between the Democratic nominees -  I think Hillary should win but that's not relevant for this discussion.  I do have stronger feelings towards who wins the Republican nomination - there is a larger variation in possible futures based on the possibility of one of the Republican nominees becoming President of the United States (POTUS)

> My primary expectation of the President of the United States is fairly simple: Don't endanger the human race. 

My primary expectation of the President of the United States is fairly simple: Don't endanger the human race. I'm willing to compromise on progress and improvement - meaning I don't expect the President to make the world a better place, so long as he/she doesn't move humanity backwards we will move forward on our own.

> I don't expect the President to make the world a better place, so long as he/she doesn't move humanity backwards humanity will move forward on its own.

I feel that depending on the Republican nominee humanity may be placed at existential risk through policies that fail to address climate change. Short of existential risk there is simply the possibility of undoing all the progress made in the past 8 years of Obama's presidency making the United States take a few steps backwards -  an inefficient outcome. 

Vote: John Kasich

Kasich is the most reasonable of the Republican field and I expect mild improvements under his Presidency.   
So in order of preference:  
Mild Improvements (Kasich) Rollback to 2008 (Rubio)   Existential Threats (Trump and Cruz)

That being said I didn't research the outcome probabilities before I voted and it seems that Kasich winning delegates in VA is unlikely but perhaps by supporting him I can signal interest in his campaign.

A Kasich v Clinton general election would be the best possible outcome from my point of view.
